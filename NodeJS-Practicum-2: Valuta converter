WORKSHOP: NODE JS VALUTA CONVERTER

BY Amer Jaganjac

Creating a simple currency converter app using Node.js is a great way to get started with back-end development. In this guide, we'll create a basic currency converter that uses an external API for current exchange rates. We'll use the `express` framework for the web server and `axios` to make HTTP requests to the currency API.

Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

1. Install Node.js: Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Create a New Directory: Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

   mkdir currency-converter
   cd currency-converter


3. Initialize a Node.js Project: Initialize a new Node.js project by running:

   npm init -y

   This command creates a `package.json` file with default values.

Step 2: Install Required Packages

Install `express` for creating the server and `axios` for making HTTP requests:


npm install express axios


Step 3: Create the Server

1. Create a File for Your Server: Create a file named `server.js` in your project directory.

2. Set Up Express Server: Open `server.js` and set up a basic Express server:

   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;

   app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Currency Converter App'));

   app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`));


Step 4: Integrate Currency Converter API

1. Choose a Currency Converter API: For this guide, we'll use the ExchangeRate-API (https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). Sign up and get your free API key.

2. Create a Route for Conversion: In `server.js`, add a new route that uses `axios` to call the ExchangeRate-API. Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your actual API key.


   const axios = require('axios');

   app.get('/convert', async (req, res) => {
     const { fromCurrency, toCurrency, amount } = req.query;
     try {
       const response = await axios.get(`https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/${fromCurrency}`, {
         params: {
           apiKey: '<YOUR_API_KEY>',
         },
       });
       const rate = response.data.rates[toCurrency];
       if (!rate) {
         return res.status(404).send('Currency not found');
       }
       const convertedAmount = (amount * rate).toFixed(2);
       res.send(`${amount} ${fromCurrency} is approximately ${convertedAmount} ${toCurrency}`);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(error);
       res.status(500).send('Error converting currency');
     }
   });


Step 5: Testing Your Application

1. Start Your Server: Run your server with:
   
   node server.js


2. Test Conversion: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/convert?fromCurrency=USD&toCurrency=EUR&amount=100`. You should see the conversion result displayed.

Congratulations! You've just created a simple currency converter app using Node.js. This app serves as a foundational project that you can expand with more features as you continue to learn.
